## Fullstack Open Solutions

The [Fullstack Open 2020 course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/ "Fullstack Open 2020") is an in-depth introduction to modern web applications built with JavaScript.

The primary focus is on building applications with ReactJS that utilize REST APIs built with Node.js. 

The course covers development, testing, configuration and environment management, along with the usage of MongoDB to store application data.

## In this repo:

My solutions to parts 0, 1, & 2 of the course can be found in their respective folders, labeled by the application name.

Later parts require applications to be in their own repos to allow for easier deployment.
